        the when Sanji's ship was wrecked, leaving him stranded on a rock with Zeff. 
        They were both starving, and in a desperate situation, Sanji discovered that Zeff had sacrificed his own leg
        to survive and had become an amputee. Zeff revealed that his dream was to own a floating restaurant called the Baratie,
        and he took Sanji under his wing, teaching him the art of cooking and instilling a strong work ethic in him.
        Under Zeff's guidance, Sanji honed his culinary skills and, found his dream which was to find the All Blue where all four 
        seas merge and where there is ocean life from every sea. there he also honed his signature fighting style, which combined
         his
       leg strength with his culinary talents.

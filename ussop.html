  <H1>Usopp's Early life</H1>
  
  <h2> Usopp was born and raised in the Syrup Village, located in the East Blue, which is the first sea that  
     the Straw Hat Pirates explore in the series. He is the son of Yasopp, a skilled sniper and member of the Red-Haired  
      Pirates, led by the legendary pirate, Shanks.    Despite his father's absence from his life, Usopp grew up idolizing
       pirates and telling tall tales to his friends     and fellow villagers. He would often fabricate stories about his 
       father's adventures and his own experiences. However,    
     deep down, Usopp felt insecure about his own abilities and feared that he would never live up to his father's legacy.

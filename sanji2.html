    <h1>Out To Sea</h1>
    <h2>One day a random kid and his crew show up to the Baratie but then the captan of he crew breaks trough a part of the ship
        then Zeff makes he kid who broke the wall work in the kitchen then the most dangerous group of pirates in the east blue show up
        their name was  Zeff and his cooks tried to persuade Sanji to leave by telling him a soup he cooked tasted awful. 
        Sanji almost fell for it, but then overheard them when they actually said it tasted delicious.
         He remembered his dream of finding the All Blue and finally agreed to join Luffy's crew. 
         Just as he made his decision, Yosaku returned, traveling on a panda shark, and warned Luffy 
         that Nami was heading toward a dangerous island. Zeff and the Baratie cooks all gave Sanji a tearful 
         send-off before he, Luffy, and Yosaku headed out to catch up with the others.</h2>

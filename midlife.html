            Nami stole a valuable map from Buggy and deceived pirates to obtain their boat and treasure. In Orange Town, Luffy rescued her from Buggy's henchmen. However, Nami betrayed Luffy and handed him over to Buggy, resulting in his imprisonment. Later, Nami saved Luffy from Buggy's orders to kill him and they escaped together. In Orange Town, Nami realized Luffy's innocence and teamed up with him and Zoro to rescue the town. Nami attempted to steal Buggy's treasure and map, but Luffy emerged victorious and she gave him the map in gratitude. They temporarily joined forces and managed to escape with Chouchou's help. Before leaving, Luffy left behind one of Nami's treasure bags to help rebuild Orange Town, earning her appreciation.

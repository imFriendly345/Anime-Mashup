    Luffy's early life was filled with adventure and a deep fascination with pirates. He grew up in the small village of Foosha in the East Blue, under the care of his grandfather, Monkey D. Garp. Garp, a legendary marine, often left Luffy in the care of Dadan, a mountain bandit, while he pursued his marine duties.

From a young age, Luffy displayed a strong will and a rebellious nature. He was known for his mischievous behavior and his refusal to back down from any challenge. Despite being warned about the dangers of the sea, Luffy remained unwavering in his dream of becoming the Pirate King.

When Luffy was seven years old, his life changed when the infamous Red-Haired Shanks and his pirate crew arrived in Foosha Village. Fascinated by their lifestyle, Luffy approached the pirates fearlessly, demanding to be taken on board their ship. Initially dismissed as a mere child, Luffy's tenacity and fearlessness impressed Shanks.</h3>

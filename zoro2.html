    <hr>
    <h2 style="padding-right: 70%;">Luffy was searching for a crew to accompany him on his journey to become the Pirate King.
        He arrived at a marine base town called Shell Town, where he learned about a formidable swordsman named Zoro, also known
        As "Pirate Hunter" Zoro.
        
        Luffy discovered that Zoro was imprisoned by the corrupt marine captain Morgan. Showing no fear,
        Luffy rushed into the marine base, defeated numerous marines, and freed Zoro from captivity. Zoro was initially sentenced to execution by Captain Morgan due to his resistance against the corrupt marine regime.
        
        Impressed by Zoro's strength and his dream of becoming the world's greatest swordsman,
        Luffy invited him to join his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates. Despite his own personal mission,
        Zoro recognized Luffy's potential and accepted.</h2>
